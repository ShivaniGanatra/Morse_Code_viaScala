Want my output handler to say hi would you like to translate from letter to code or vice versa?
User inputs letters or morse code

One space between Morse characters (e.g., .... . .-.. .-.. ---)
Use "/" for word separation (e.g., .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..)
Use map to split letters is it has a space between then and a dash
then return output and vice versa

If use selects something that isn't a valid letter or more code then it wont throw an error it'll just tell the
user to try again

Want to make a function that iterates over every peice of the morse code
if this is a morse code -> then its this letter
if space then join?
else if theres an incorrect thing try again

separate function for english to morse than morse to english

Need to go over use commands in scala, mapping in scala
