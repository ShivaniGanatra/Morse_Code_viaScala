Morse Code Scala Instructions
Functional Requirements
Accept user input via command line
Translate:
English → Morse
Morse → English
Follow these spacing conventions:
One space between Morse characters (e.g., .... . .-.. .-.. ---)
Use "/" for word separation (e.g., .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..)

Architecture
Split the program into the following Scala objects/classes:

InputHandler: Handles reading and validating input
OutputHandler: Handles printing the result
Translator: Contains all conversion logic
MorseCode: Stores the Morse mappings (as a Map[Char, String])
Use pure functions in Translator to make testing easy.

Unit Testing
Use ScalaTest
Test:
English to Morse
Morse to English
